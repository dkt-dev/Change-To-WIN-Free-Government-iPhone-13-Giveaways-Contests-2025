These programs aim to provide low-income individuals and families with access to essential communication tools. But how do you qualify? And how can you apply? Letâ€™s dive in!  

### **Who Qualifies for a Free iPhone 13?**  
Not everyone can get a free iPhone 13. The government sets specific requirements to ensure that only those in need receive assistance. Here are the main ways to qualify:
